# Graph Isomorphism Problem
#
# This example shows how to use Boscia to certify whether two graphs are isomorphic.
# We encode graph isomorphism via a permutation matrix X that reorders the vertices.
# Given adjacency matrices A and B, the graphs are isomorphic iff there exists a
# permutation matrix X such that:
#   X * A = B * X
# Equivalently, we consider the smooth objective
# ```math
#   f(X) = \| X A - B X \|_F^2,
# ```
# which attains the value 0 exactly at an isomorphism. We solve over the Birkhoff
# polytope (convex hull of permutation matrices) with a branch-and-bound scheme
# plus Frank–Wolfe in the nodes; the lower bound allows pruning, and a zero
# incumbent certifies isomorphism.
#
# We also add a simple neighborhood heuristic that (randomly) swaps two rows'
# 1-positions in a permutation matrix to explore nearby vertices.

# ## Generate a random isomorphic graph
# Given an adjacency matrix A, this function creates a random permutation
# matrix P and returns the permuted adjacency matrix B = P * A * P'.
# The resulting graphs A and B are isomorphic, and P encodes the vertex
# relabeling between them.

# Given an adjacency matrix A, this function randomly toggles one edge 
# (adds or removes it) to create a new graph B. The resulting graph B 
# is symmetric and typically non-isomorphic to A.

# positions—producing a neighboring permutation matrix. Repeating k times yields k
# candidate neighbors.
