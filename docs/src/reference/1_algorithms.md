# Algorithm Interface

Boscia's `solve` function only requires the oracles of the objective function `f` and its gradient `g` as well as the BLMO encoding the feasible region.

Modules = [Boscia]

```

## Optional settings

Boscia has a lot of settings to customize the solving process. These are grouped by general Branch-and-Bound settings, settings specific for Frank-Wolfe, tolerances settings for both the tree as well as Frank-Wolfe. 
Furthermore, there are settings for the heuristics, for bound tightenings, postprocessing and for the case of a non-trivial domain, i.e. the objective cannot be evaluated at all points of the feasible region.

## Definitions

Boscia defines its own solving state. 
Additionally, Boscia has different modes, like the `DEFAULT_MODE` and `HEURISTIC_MODE`.
These have their own default settings for the optional parameters.
