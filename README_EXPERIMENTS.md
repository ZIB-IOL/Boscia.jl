This README summarizes the experiments presented in the manuscript "Convex mixed-integer optimization with Frank-Wolfe methods".

Assuming the `julia` binary is available, first run:
```shell
julia --project "using Pkg; Pkg.update()"
```
in the `Boscia` folder to download and set up all dependencies.

To run some examples, run `test` in the REPL: 
```shell
julia --project
] test
```
The examples tested are all included in the test folder, see `runtests.jl`.
