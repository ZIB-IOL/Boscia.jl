### About The Project

### Examples
- portfolio

### CSV files
- the results for the integer and mixed portfolio problem are generated by "run_portfolio.jl"
- the results for the Poisson regression problem are generated by "run_poisson.jl"
- the results for the sparse regression problem are generated by "run_sparse_reg.jl"
- the results for the sparse logistic regression problem are generated by "run_sparse_log_reg.jl"
- the results for the tailed sparse regression problem are generated by "run_tailed_cardinality.jl"
- the results for the tailed sparse logistic regression problem are generated by "run_tailed_cardinality_sparse_log_reg.jl"
- the results for the miplib problems are generated by "run_mip_lib.jl". The miplib examples include the following problems: neos5, 22433, pg5_34, ran14x18-disj-8
- the results for the comparison between the big M formulation and indicator constraints are generated by  "run_bigM_vs_indicator.jl". Including the following problems: Lasso, sparse regression, Poisson regression, integer regression
